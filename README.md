# LangChain_Chatbot

We will go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions.
Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation. There are several other related concepts that you may be looking for:
